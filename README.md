# Stock-Price-Prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts future stock prices based on historical data. The model utilizes various features such as past stock prices and trading volume. I've developed individual prediction models for individual companies, and then merged their forecasts to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
